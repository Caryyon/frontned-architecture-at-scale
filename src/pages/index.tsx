          <p>
            {FAAS} started with an idea that frontend architecture has grown
            beyond its early stages and that we as a community should be sharing
            our experiences. A Friday Clubhouse about micro-frontends has
            solidified into something much more. With a rotating panel of guests
            and topics, itâ€™s sure to be educational as well as diverse and
            entertaining.
